                        Programming means writing instructions for a computer to perform desired actions.

                        It is one of the most in-demand skills in the world.
                        
                        Mobile apps, video games, websites, or any other piece of software is written by a programmer.
                        
                        There are lots of things you need to understand to wrap your head around programming.                
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        It is also important to realize programming is not all about writing code. Instead, programming is governed by a broader skill, software development.
                        
                        In this article, you will learn everything you need to know about programming and software development.
                        
                        In addition, you are going to find valuable information on how to become a software developer yourself.

                            Today: Computer programming languages in use today were built on the concepts designed in older languages. Many older languages are still in use today or are being used as a foundation for new languages. The newer computer programming languages often aim to simplify the work of programmers. The continual expansion of technology ensures that computer programming languages will remain an integral part of modern life for a long time to come.

                            Today: Computer programming languages in use today were built on the concepts designed in older languages. Many older languages are still in use today or are being used as a foundation for new languages. The newer computer programming languages often aim to simplify the work of programmers. The continual expansion of technology ensures that computer programming languages will remain an integral part of modern life for a long time to come.
