                            We use our phones in more and more situations, you can now pay with your phone instead of a credit card, plan a cycling route and measure your performance, control smartwatches from your phone, order food, and so on. All of this requires mobile apps, and if you can program, you can develop a mobile app to implement any cool idea.

                            It’s true that to develop desktop apps you need to have some serious programming skills in programming languages like C++, C# or Java, but it’s not impossible to do, since even the people who developed Microsoft Word or Adobe products (Photoshop, Illustrator) had to start somewhere.

                            Small databases can be managed without any programming skills. However, different functions are used even in an Excel spreadsheet if one wants to extract information more efficiently. But for building, maintaining and using a larger database, some knowledge of programming languages such as PHP or SQL is very useful, or in some cases essential.

                            A DevOps engineer plays a transitional role between the hardware tasks of an administrator and the software tasks of a developer. They can be developers involved in the installation, testing and operation of the infrastructure and the support of the users, or system administrators who are more confident in programming, reviewing, updating and upgrading the code.

                            Data science is a complex discipline that combines mathematics, statistics, machine learning, programming skills, presentation skills and expertise in a specific area of research. It is about developing models to make predictions based on the information derived from the data.

                            Artificial intelligence is the field of science that seeks to research and develop machines capable of making autonomous decisions based on large amounts of data. It does this by using machine learning methods.

                            AI controls self-driving cars (e.g. Tesla Autopilot), robots that can sense their environment (e.g. Boston Dynamics robots) and digital assistants that can recognize the voice and interpret speech, such as Siri or Alexa.

                            Scientific research often involves the analysis and modelling of large amounts of data, which requires the use of certain programming languages. If you are interested in the natural sciences, it may be a good idea to complement your studies with programming.

                            <span>1. Variables:</span> 
                            As the foundation of any computer programming language, variables act as “containers” that “hold” information. These containers then store this information for later use.
                            <br> <br>
                            For example, imagine you are visiting the homepage of a website. Once you land on this page, a dialog box pops into view with this simple greeting: “Hi! What’s your name?” This dialog box is a variable! In this code, the programmer could name this variable “visitorName.” This means that when you type your name into the form and hit submit, your information would be stored in the “visitorName” variable. The programmer could then reference this variable at any time to access the information it contains.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span>2. Data Structures:</span>
                            Data structures allow programmers to streamline data collection when a large amount of related information is involved. Let’s go back to our “visitorName” variable from above, but imagine the computer programmer needs to store and reference 10 different visitors’ names rather than just one. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Rather than creating 10 different variables for each new visitor — which would increase the sheer amount of text in the program and make adding or removing new contacts difficult — the programmer could simply use a data structure to contain all related variables. In this case, the data structure would be a List. 
                            <br><br>
                            With this List data structure, the programmer only needs to create one variable rather than 10, which means the code would be much more flexible to change.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span>3. Control Structures:</span>
                            A control structure analyzes variables and selects a direction in which to go determined from the given parameters. For example, when a computer program is running, the code is being read by the computer line by line from top to bottom and (for the most part) left to right. 
                            <br><br>
                            As the code is being read, the computer will reach a point where it needs to make a “decision” (based on strict rules set by the computer programmer). At this point, the code could do things like jump to a different part of the program, re-run a certain piece of code again, or simply skip a block of code altogether. 
                            <br><br>
                            Whatever parameters are set by the programmer will affect the code flow. Think of control structures as the directions your program needs to allow it to make choices and execute commands under different conditions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span>4. Syntax:</span>
                            Just like in the English language, computer programming follows a syntax or a set of rules that define particular layouts of letters and symbols. Proper syntax ensures the computer reads and interprets code accurately. For example, let’s consider a simple email address and its required syntax. 
                            <br><br>
                            Email addresses are understood by readers and computers immediately due to their format. Typically, email addresses must consist of a string of letters and numbers, followed by the “@” symbol, and finally a website domain (e.g., bob_smith@companyname.com). This structure is known as the standard email syntax! It’s easy to imagine that if the email address were not syntactically correct (company@.comnamebob_smith), computers would not be able to process it.
                            <br><br>
                            In a similar fashion, each computer programming language has its own syntax or appropriate order in how code should be written for the program to understand what it is supposed to do.
                        </p> 

                        <p>
                            <span>5. Tools:</span>
                            In the physical world, tools allow workers to perform tasks that would otherwise be extremely difficult (think of how a hammer helps drive a nail into a piece of wood and what this job would be like without tools). Similarly, a tool in computer programming is a piece of software that helps programmers write code much faster. 
                            <br><br>
                            For example, one of the most important tools for computer programmers is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE can check the syntax of code for errors, organize files, autocomplete commonly used code, and help you easily navigate through your code. Tools are the final crucial element to code, as they streamline processes and ensure accuracy.
