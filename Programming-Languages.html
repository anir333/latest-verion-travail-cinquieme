                Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array of computer programming languages that programmers can use to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary.” Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.” Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages. 
                <br><br>
                These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information. For example, if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order, chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
                <br><br>
                There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today. Down below you will find more information about the 7 of the most used and interesting programming languages nowadays.

                        - CSS Solved a Big Problem:
                        <li>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page, HTML was created to describe the content of a web page.
                        </li>
                        <li>When tags like '< font >', and color attributes were added to the HTML  3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
                            <br>
                        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.                    
                        <li>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</li>
                        <li>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</li>
                        <li>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</li>
                        <li>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</li>

                1996 - The first version of CSS was invented. 1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules.

                SQL interacts with the backend database of web application. It is the “de facto standard” database language, always used in conjunction with another programming language. SQL programs are implemented as a way for businesses and organizations to access and manipulate information stored in their databases.
